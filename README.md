# Auditing-Oracle

Based on Oracle Database Securiy Guide recommendations, the script performs queries to Oracle databases by reading controls stored in a MySQL schema and carries out data analytic procedures on the generated (';' delimmited) files. Also, performs AIX/Linux query controls by using SSH.

For this, or others systems/plattforms (Cybersecurity, Oracle, MySQL, AIX, among others), pls, contact me! (luis.alfie@gmail.com)
