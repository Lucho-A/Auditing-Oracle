# Auditing-Oracle

*(Under development)* Based on Oracle Database Securiy Guide recommendations (Apr. 2022), the script performs queries to Oracle databases by reading controls stored in a MySQL schema and carries out data analytic procedures on the generated (';' delimited) files. Also, performs AIX/Linux query controls by using SSH.

For any questions, as well, for others systems/plattforms (Cybersecurity, SAP HANA, MySQL, AIX, among others), pls, contact me! <luis.alfie@gmail.com>
